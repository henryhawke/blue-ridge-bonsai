        entries.forEach((entry) => {
          if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            const element = entry.target;
            const styles = getComputedStyle(element);
            const bgColor = styles.backgroundColor;

            // Simple luminance calculation

      },
      {
        rootMargin: "-80px 0px 0px 0px",
      }
    );

    // Observe all major content sections
    document
      .querySelectorAll("section, .hero, .content-block")
      .forEach((section) => observer.observe(section));
  }

  isColorLight(color) {
    // Convert color to RGB and calculate luminance
    const rgb = color.match(/\d+/g);
    if (!rgb) return true;

    const [r, g, b] = rgb.map(Number);
    const luminance = (0.299 * r + 0.587 * g + 0.114 * b) / 255;
    return luminance > 0.5;
  }

  observeContentChanges() {
    // Re-calculate when content changes (for dynamic content)
    const observer = new MutationObserver(() => {
      this.calculateContentContrast();
    });

    observer.observe(document.body, {
      childList: true,
      subtree: true,
      attributes: true,
      attributeFilter: ["style", "class"],
    });
  }
}

// Initialize when DOM is ready
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  new LiquidGlassNavigation();
});
```

## Risk Mitigation & Quality Assurance

### Risk Management

**1. Browser Compatibility & Fallbacks**

- **Risk**: Liquid glass effects not supported in older browsers
- **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement with CSS feature detection
- **Fallback**: Solid navigation with reduced opacity for unsupported browsers

**2. Performance with Complex Animations**

- **Risk**: Animations causing jank on lower-end devices
- **Mitigation**: Performance budgets, animation profiling, CPU throttling tests
- **Fallback**: Reduced motion mode with CSS `prefers-reduced-motion`

- **Risk**: Complex interactions hindering accessibility
- **Mitigation**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader testing
- **Fallback**: Simplified interaction modes for assistive technologies

**4. Content Management Complexity**

- **Risk**: Advanced features being too complex for content editors
- **Mitigation**: Simplified admin interfaces, comprehensive training materials
- **Fallback**: Traditional content editing modes alongside advanced features

### Quality Assurance Protocol

**1. Automated Testing Suite**

- Visual regression testing with tools like Percy or Chromatic
- Cross-browser testing with BrowserStack integration
- Performance regression testing with Lighthouse CI
- Accessibility testing with axe-core automation

**2. Manual Testing Protocol**
