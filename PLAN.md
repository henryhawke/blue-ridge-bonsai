## Risks & Mitigations

**1. Wix Plan Limitations**
   - **Risks**: Current plan may not support all future requirements as business grows (e.g., storage, bandwidth).
   - **Mitigations**: Monitor usage to ensure it remains within limits; explore alternate hosting solutions if necessary.

**2. Performance Issues with Heavy Galleries**
   - **Risks**: Galleries with many images may impact site performance and user experience.
   - **Mitigations**: Implement lazy-loading for images to improve load times and performance.

**3. Member Permission Complexity**
   - **Risks**: Increasing complexity in managing member permissions could lead to security vulnerabilities.
   - **Mitigations**: Phased feature gating to ensure functionality is tested incrementally before full rollout.

**4. Content Backlog**
   - **Risks**: A backlog of content could delay project timelines and affect deliverables.
   - **Mitigations**: Implement a prioritized content pipeline to ensure timely processing and publishing of key content.
