## 🚨 IMPORTANT: CSS Setup Required for Styling

The JavaScript code is now running correctly, but **you need to add the CSS file to Wix** for the visual styling to work. Here's how:

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Copy the CSS File Content

Open the file: `src/public/styles/global.css` and copy ALL the content.

### 2. Add CSS to Your Wix Site

**Option A: Using Wix Editor (Recommended)**
1. In your Wix Editor, go to **Settings** → **Advanced** → **Custom Code**
2. Click **Add Custom Code**
3. Paste the CSS content wrapped in `<style>` tags:
   ```html
   <style>
   /* Paste the entire global.css content here */
   </style>
   ```
4. Set the location to **All Pages**
5. Set to load in the **Head**

**Option B: Using Wix Studio**
1. In Wix Studio, go to the **CSS Panel** (paintbrush icon)
2. Add a new CSS file or edit the global styles
3. Paste the entire `global.css` content

### 3. Verify Setup

After adding the CSS, you should see:
- ✅ Liquid glass navigation with blur effects
- ✅ Enhanced button styling with hover effects
- ✅ Atmospheric background effects
- ✅ Improved typography and spacing
- ✅ Seasonal color adaptations
- ✅ Smooth animations and micro-interactions

## 🔧 Current Status

✅ **JavaScript Code**: Working correctly - all console logs show success  
❌ **CSS Styling**: Needs to be added to Wix (follow steps above)

## 🎨 What the CSS Includes

- **Liquid Glass Navigation**: Backdrop blur, reflection effects, dynamic opacity
- **Design System**: Mountain Sage color palette, enhanced typography
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Particle animations, seasonal adaptations
- **Enhanced Components**: Buttons, cards, inputs, containers
- **Animations**: Fade-in, slide-up, scale-in, hover effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layouts
- **Accessibility**: Focus states, reduced motion support

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If styling still doesn't appear:**

1. **Check CSS is loaded**: In browser dev tools, look for the custom styles
2. **Clear cache**: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Check element IDs**: Verify your Wix elements have the expected IDs:
   - Header: `#SITE_HEADER`
   - Navigation: `#navBar`
   - Main container: `#SITE_CONTAINER`

**If some elements aren't styled:**

The JavaScript will try common Wix element IDs. If your elements have different IDs, update the selectors in `masterPage.js`:

```javascript
// Example: Change these selectors to match your element IDs
const headerSelectors = ["#SITE_HEADER", "#header", "#wixHeader", "#YOUR_HEADER_ID"];
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

Once the CSS is properly added, your site will transform from the default Wix template to a beautiful, atmospheric design with:

- Glassmorphism navigation that adapts to content
- Smooth hover animations
- Professional typography
- Mountain-inspired color palette
- Subtle particle effects
- Enhanced accessibility features

## 📞 Need Help?

If you're still having issues after following these steps, check:
1. Did you copy the ENTIRE global.css file content?
2. Is it wrapped in `<style>` tags in Wix?
3. Is it set to load on all pages?
4. Have you cleared your browser cache?

The JavaScript code is working perfectly - it just needs the CSS file to complete the visual transformation! 🚀
