        "content": "Hi Bob, welcome! Yellowing on lower branches is sometimes normal as the tree sheds older foliage to focus on new growth. However, it can also be a sign of overwatering or underwatering. Does your pot have good drainage? Junipers also love full sun, so if you can give it more than 4 hours, that would be ideal.",
