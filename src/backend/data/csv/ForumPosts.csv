fpost002,fcat002,Help! My Juniper is turning yellow!,"Hi everyone, I'm new here. I got a Japanese Juniper a few weeks ago and some of the lower foliage is starting to turn yellow and feel brittle. I'm watering it every 2-3 days when the soil feels dry. It gets about 4 hours of direct sun. Any advice?",mem002,Bob Smith,2025-08-12T14:00:00Z,"[{""_id"":""freply002"",""authorId"":""mem001"",""authorName"":""David Anderson"",""content"":""Hi Bob, welcome! Yellowing on lower branches is sometimes normal as the tree sheds older foliage to focus on new growth. However, it can also be a sign of overwatering or underwatering. Does your pot have good drainage? Junipers also love full sun, so if you can give it more than 4 hours, that would be ideal."",""postDate"":""2025-08-12T15:00:00Z""},{""_id"":""freply003"",""authorId"":""mem001"",""authorName"":""Jane Doe"",""content"":""I agree with David. I'd also check the soil moisture deeper down. Sometimes the top feels dry but the bottom is still soggy. A wooden chopstick is a great tool for this - stick it in, pull it out, and see if it's damp."",""postDate"":""2025-08-12T16:30:00Z""}]",juniper;help;beginner;yellowing,false,15
