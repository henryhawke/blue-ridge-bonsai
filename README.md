    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - run: wix deploy --prod
        env:
          WIX_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WIX_API_KEY }}
```

### **Step 12: Performance Optimization**

Configure your site for optimal performance:

#### **Build Optimization**

```json

## How Velo Integration Works

Your Wix site is connected to this GitHub repository. However, simply committing and pushing changes to the `main` branch is **not** enough to make them appear on your live site.

You must use the **Wix Local Editor** to see your code changes and then **publish** the site from the Wix Editor to make them live.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Local Environment

First, you need to set up your computer to work with Velo.

1.  **Install Prerequisites:**

    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 14.8 or later)
    - [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) (comes with Node.js)

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to store your project, and run:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory-name>
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the necessary packages for the project:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Install the Wix CLI:**
    The Wix Command Line Interface (CLI) is required to work with your site locally. Install it globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @wix/cli
    ```

## Step 2: Start the Local Development Server

The Wix Local Editor is a local version of the Wix Editor that runs on your computer and syncs with your local code files. This is where you will see your changes reflected in real-time.

1.  **Log in to Wix:**
    In your terminal, run the following command to log in to your Wix account:

    ```bash
    wix login
    ```

    This will open a browser window for you to log in.

2.  **Start the Dev Server:**
    From the root directory of your project, run:
    ```bash
    wix dev
    ```
    This command will do two things:
    - It will open the **Wix Local Editor** on your computer.
    - It will watch your local files for changes and sync them with the Local Editor instantly.

## Step 3: Making and Viewing Code Changes

Now you can start coding!

1.  **Edit the Code:**
    Open the project in your favorite code editor (like VS Code). You can now edit the files in the `src` directory. For example, you can change styles in `src/public/global.css` or add logic to `src/pages/masterPage.js`.

2.  **View Changes in the Local Editor:**
    As you save your files, the `wix dev` command will automatically sync them to the Local Editor. You can see your changes reflected there immediately. Use the "Preview" mode in the Local Editor to see the site as a visitor would.

    This is the primary way you should be developing and testing your code.

## Step 4: Publishing Your Site

When you are happy with your changes in the Local Editor, you need to publish them to make them live on your actual website.

1.  **Sync to the Wix Editor:**
    In the Local Editor, your changes are synced automatically. You can open your live site editor on wix.com to see the changes there as well.

2.  **Publish:**
    Click the **Publish** button in the main Wix Editor (the one in your browser) to make your changes live for everyone to see.

## Summary of the Correct Workflow

1.  Run `wix dev` in your terminal.
2.  Edit code in your local IDE.
3.  See changes in the Local Editor that opened.
4.  When ready, go to the main Wix Editor online and click **Publish**.
