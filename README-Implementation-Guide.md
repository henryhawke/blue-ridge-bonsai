## üö® Important: Making Code Changes Visible on Website

The JavaScript code we've implemented provides the **functionality and logic**, but to see changes on the actual Wix website, you need to:

### 1. **Use Wix Editor for Page Elements**
The JavaScript code expects certain HTML elements to exist on the pages. You need to add these through the Wix Editor:

#### Homepage Elements Needed:
- Container with ID: `#main`, `#page-content`, or `#content`
- Hero section with:
  - `#heroTitle` - Main title text
  - `#heroSubtitle` - Subtitle text  
  - `#ctaJoinButton` - Primary call-to-action button
  - `#ctaEventsButton` - Events button
  - `#ctaLearningButton` - Learning button
  - `#ctaAboutButton` - About button

#### Events Page Elements Needed:
- Main container
- Filter controls: `#categoryFilter`, `#dateFilter`, `#difficultyFilter`
- Search input: `#searchInput`
- View toggle buttons: `#gridViewBtn`, `#calendarViewBtn`
- Content containers: `#eventsGrid`, `#calendarView`

#### Learning Center Elements Needed:
- Navigation tabs with `data-section` attributes
- Section containers: `#beginners-guide`, `#knowledge-base`, `#resources`, `#vendors`
- Search and filter elements

### 2. **CSS Styling Integration**
Our code includes comprehensive CSS that should be added to your Wix site:

#### Option A: Add to Site-Wide CSS
Copy the CSS from each page file (the large `<style>` blocks) into your Wix site's custom CSS section.

#### Option B: Use Wix Design System
Recreate the glass morphism and atmospheric design using Wix's design tools:
- **Colors**: Mountain Sage (#6B8E6F), Stone Gray (#4A4A4A), Cloud White (#FEFFFE)
- **Typography**: Inter font family, proper hierarchy
- **Effects**: Glass morphism with backdrop blur, subtle shadows

### 3. **Database Collections Setup**
Create these collections in your Wix database:

#### Events Collection:
```javascript
{
  title: "Text",
  description: "Rich Text", 
  startDate: "Date",
  endDate: "Date",
  category: "Text",
  difficulty: "Text",
  location: "Text",
  maxAttendees: "Number",
  currentAttendees: "Number",
  price: "Number",
  featured: "Boolean",
  instructor: "Text",
  image: "Image"
}
```

#### Articles Collection:
```javascript
{
  title: "Text",
  excerpt: "Text",
  content: "Rich Text",
  category: "Text", 
  difficulty: "Text",
  tags: "Tags",
  author: "Text",
  publishDate: "Date",
  views: "Number",
  featured: "Boolean",
  readTime: "Number"
}
```

#### Members Collection:
```javascript
{
  firstName: "Text",
  lastName: "Text", 
  email: "Text",
  membershipLevel: "Text",
  joinDate: "Date",
  isActive: "Boolean",
  bio: "Rich Text",
  yearsExperience: "Number"
}
```

### 4. **Testing the Implementation**

#### Local Testing with `wix dev`:
1. Run `wix dev` to start the Local Editor
2. Add the required HTML elements through the Wix Editor
3. Test the JavaScript functionality in the browser
4. Check browser console for our logged messages

#### Production Deployment:
1. Commit changes to Git repository
2. Wix will automatically deploy from the main branch
3. Verify functionality on the live site

### 5. **What Each Implementation Provides**

#### ‚úÖ Homepage (`Home.c1dmp.js`):
- **Dynamic welcome messages** based on login status
- **Events preview** with latest 3 upcoming events
- **Member spotlight** rotation

- **NC Arboretum partnership** information
- **Interactive FAQ** system with toggle functionality
- **Meeting information** with visitor guidance
- **Society statistics** and achievements

#### ‚úÖ Events System (`Events.yyqhk.js` + `event-system.js`):

- **Search functionality** across events
- **Calendar and grid views** with smooth transitions
- **Event registration** system with capacity tracking
- **RSS feed generation** for external calendar apps

#### Next Steps:
- üîÑ **Membership System** (in progress)
- ‚è≥ **Database collections setup**
- ‚è≥ **NPM packages installation**
- ‚è≥ **Mobile responsive testing**

### 7. **Technical Architecture**

Our implementation uses:
- **Environment Detection**: Works in both browser and server environments
- **Mock APIs**: Provides fallback data for testing
- **Safe DOM Manipulation**: Handles missing elements gracefully
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even if some features fail
- **Modular Design**: Each page is self-contained with its own styling

### 8. **Getting Support**

If you need help implementing these changes in the Wix Editor:
1. Check the browser console for detailed logging from our code
2. Verify that required HTML elements exist on each page
3. Ensure database collections are properly configured
4. Test with `wix dev` before deploying to production

The code we've written provides a solid foundation - now it needs to be connected to the actual Wix page elements through the Editor interface.
