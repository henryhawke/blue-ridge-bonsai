Blue Ridge Bonsai Society: Proposed Website Sitemap and Information Architecture
1. Introduction
This report outlines a proposed sitemap and information architecture for the new Blue Ridge Bonsai Society (BRBS) website. The primary objective is to create a user-centered, intuitive, and comprehensive online presence that effectively serves current members, attracts new enthusiasts, and supports the society's mission. The proposed structure is derived from an analysis of stakeholder requirements, including committee and member feedback 1, and an evaluation of the existing blueridgebonsaisociety.com website.2 The methodology involved synthesizing these inputs to design a sitemap that is both functional and aligned with the society's goals, ensuring all critical information is easily accessible and logically organized.
2. Executive Summary of Proposed Sitemap
The proposed sitemap is designed to provide a clear, organized, and engaging user experience. It prioritizes ease of navigation and access to key information, such as event details, learning resources, and membership information. The structure aims to reduce clutter, particularly on the homepage, by distributing content into logical top-level sections. These main sections include: "Home," "About Us," "Events," "Learn," "Join Us," "Members Area," and "Contact Us." A comprehensive footer will provide access to supplementary information and administrative links. This architecture directly addresses the need for a more organized and user-friendly interface and ensures that critical content is readily discoverable, adhering to the principle of keeping information within a few clicks.
3. Proposed Sitemap Structure (Detailed)

3.4. Rationale for Structure
The proposed structure is grounded in established usability principles and directly responds to the identified requirements. A key driver is the need for a "cleaner, less busy, and more organized" homepage. The current homepage 2 is dense with chronological event listings. By creating distinct top-level sections like "Events," "Learn," and "Join Us," the new homepage can serve as an engaging entry point, highlighting key information and directing users to these dedicated areas. This approach avoids overwhelming users and makes it easier for them to find specific content.
Furthermore, the structure adheres to the "no content more than 2 clicks away" principle where feasible, particularly for high-priority information. This is achieved through a relatively shallow navigation depth and clear labeling. For instance, information on upcoming club activities, a "Must" requirement, is directly accessible via "Events > Upcoming Events."
The following table demonstrates how key "Must" (M) and "Should" (S) requirements from the requirements document 1 are addressed within this sitemap.

	This traceability ensures that the sitemap is not an arbitrary construct but a direct response to documented needs, providing a clear path for users to find essential information and for administrators to manage content effectively.
3.5. Navigation Principles
The proposed sitemap is guided by several core navigation principles:
* Clarity: Uses common and intuitive web terminology (e.g., "About Us," "Events," "Contact Us") to ensure users can easily understand the purpose of each section.
* Consistency: Similar types of content are grouped logically. For example, all event-related information is consolidated under the "Events" hub.
* Discoverability: Key information, especially for prospective members (as per BR-04, BR-09), is made prominent and easy to find (e.g., "Join Us" as a top-level item).
* Efficiency: The structure aims to meet the requirement of "no content more than 2 clicks away from any page" for most critical information, supported by a logical hierarchy and planned site search functionality.
* Mobile-Friendliness (BR-33): While primarily a design and development consideration, the sitemap's structure is designed to be adaptable to responsive navigation patterns, such as hamburger menus, ensuring a good user experience on all devices.
The emphasis on a "cleaner, less busy, and more organized" homepage is a direct influence on this structure. A cluttered homepage often arises from a lack of clear, alternative locations for diverse content. By providing well-defined sections like "Learn," "Events," and "Join Us," the homepage can function as an effective "shop window," showcasing key items and calls to action from these sections, rather than attempting to contain all information itself. This directly supports the goal of a more streamlined and welcoming initial user experience.
4. Key Functional Areas in the Sitemap (Detailed Exploration)
Several areas within the sitemap are designated as key functional hubs due to the number of requirements they address and their importance to the society's operations and member engagement.
4.1. Events Hub
The "Events" section is envisioned as a dynamic and comprehensive hub. It consolidates numerous requirements: easy access to information on current and upcoming activities, a calendar view, event registration capabilities, an RSS feed for calendar integration, clear event information possibly using badging, abbreviated event summaries with links to more detailed pages, and an archive of past events including photos.
The current website heavily features events, often in a long, chronological list on the homepage.2 The new structure organizes this information more systematically with distinct sub-sections for "Upcoming Events," an "Event Calendar," and a "Past Events Archive." Details from external event listings, such as the annual show information regarding guest artists, workshops, and vendors 4, indicate the necessity for robust event detail pages that can accommodate rich content.
A well-organized and comprehensive "Events" section directly supports member engagement and serves as a significant attraction for potential new members. Facilitating easy registration and providing clear, unambiguous information reduces friction for users, which can lead to increased participation in workshops, meetings, and shows. The archive of past events, complete with imagery, serves to showcase the club's vibrancy and history, further enhancing its appeal. If events are difficult to locate or understand, or if the registration process is cumbersome, attendance and engagement may be negatively impacted. By structuring event information logically and providing modern conveniences like online registration and calendar feeds, the overall event experience is enhanced, thereby increasing the perceived value of club membership and participation.
4.2. Learning Center (Knowledge Hub)
The "Learn" section is designed to be a central repository for bonsai knowledge, directly addressing the "Must" requirement for "Organized bonsai knowledge/advice to members". It will also prominently feature a "Beginner's section" to welcome and guide newcomers, and an "Updated list of vendors in resource section" as a practical tool for all members.
This hub will integrate and expand upon existing content, such as the "BRBS Monthly Bonsai Tips" and downloadable resources like the PowerPoint presentation on the "Shag Rug" method, currently found on the "Tips, Advice, & More" page of the existing site.2 A key enhancement will be the organization and searchability of this content, fulfilling the "organized/searchable and more specialized" aspect of requirement BR-03. Articles and tips can be categorized by topic (e.g., species-specific care, pruning techniques, seasonal advice) and made searchable, allowing members to quickly find relevant information.
A strong "Learn" section positions the Blue Ridge Bonsai Society as an authority and a valuable educational resource. This not only benefits current members in their horticultural pursuits but also acts as a significant draw for individuals looking to learn about bonsai, thereby supporting the society's goal of helping each member "gain in knowledge of how to develop a show-quality bonsai".2 Such a resource can attract new members who are specifically seeking guidance and education, and it can play a crucial role in retaining existing members by continuously providing value. The development of this knowledge hub is therefore central to the club's educational mission and its growth.
4.3. Membership Portal (Join Us & Payment)
The "Join Us" section is critical for membership growth and focuses on creating a welcoming and straightforward process for prospective members. It directly addresses the "Must" requirement for "Content that attracts new members and provides an easy on ramp for joining" and includes a clear "New membership form".
A key feature will be the "New member interest form", allowing individuals to express interest in attending a sample meeting. As per the requirement notes, this form should be prominently displayed and accessible without requiring a login, serving as a low-barrier entry point for those curious about the society. The current website lacks a clear, direct membership application pathway 2, making it potentially difficult for interested individuals to join.
The portal will also integrate payment processing for membership dues and potentially for workshop fees or other items. The technical note regarding Wix potentially forcing users into a business account for e-commerce functionalities is an important consideration for platform selection, but the sitemap must accommodate the functional need for online payments.
A streamlined and welcoming "Join Us" process is fundamental for converting interest into active membership. Any friction in this process, such as a hard-to-find application form, unclear benefits, or a complicated payment system, can directly hinder the society's growth. By centralizing all relevant information—benefits, membership levels, application forms, and payment options—into a dedicated and easy-to-navigate section, the society can significantly improve its ability to attract and onboard new members. The "New member interest form" further supports this by offering a non-committal way for individuals to engage with the club before formally joining.
4.4. Secure Members-Only Area
The creation of a "Members only section accessed by login" is a "Should" priority requirement and forms a cornerstone of the value proposition for BRBS members. This secure area will house features designed to foster community and provide exclusive resources.
Key components include discussion forums organized into relevant sub-forums and categories (e.g., "Advice for working in our biome, repotting, shade cloth, soils/substrates"), and a "Helpline Q&A" where members can ask bonsai questions, curated by experienced members, as specified to be behind a member login. Access to a list of current members for board members, noted as "Not sure how this might fit in?", can be effectively managed within this secure area, with appropriate permissions ensuring only authorized individuals can view sensitive data. The administrative function to "turn current list of members easily into a list of emails for club communications" could also be integrated here if member data is managed through the website's user system.
The requirement notes for BR-31 also suggest the potential for "digital members" who could access "streams of expert trainings/demos, resources." This implies that the Members Area must be capable of supporting diverse content types, including video and downloadable materials, and potentially different access levels for various membership tiers.
The success of the "Members Area" as a valuable component of BRBS membership hinges on the quality and exclusivity of its content and the vibrancy of its community features. Active and helpful discussion forums and Q&A sections can significantly enhance the member experience, fostering a sense of community and shared learning. If this area provides tangible benefits, such as access to unique educational materials or direct support from experienced members, it will strengthen member retention. Furthermore, the prospect of exclusive content for "digital members" could open new avenues for expanding the society's reach and potentially generating revenue, transcending geographical limitations. Thus, the Members Area is not merely a feature but a strategic asset that can contribute to the long-term health and growth of the society.
5. Addressing Specific Requirements & Current Site Content
This section details how specific requirements with placement queries are handled and how content from the current blueridgebonsaisociety.com will be integrated or reorganized.
5.1. Solutions for "Where this goes in sitemap" requirements
Several requirements included notes indicating a need to determine their placement within the sitemap.1 The proposed sitemap addresses these as follows:
* BR-07 (Archive of past club activities/events, including photos from the event): This "Must" requirement is logically placed under "Events > Past Events Archive." This consolidates all event-related information, making it easy for users to find historical records and visual documentation of club activities.
* BR-12 (List of current members that is easy to access for board members): This "Could" requirement, with the note "Not sure how this might fit in?", is addressed by placing a "Member Directory" within the secure "Members Area." Access can be restricted to board members or other authorized personnel, ensuring data privacy while meeting the need for accessibility.
* BR-20 (Beginner's section, links to internal and external resources): This "Must" requirement is prominently featured as "Learn > Beginner's Bonsai Guide." This high visibility ensures that newcomers can easily find foundational information and resources.
* BR-21 (Updated list of vendors in resource section): This "Must" requirement is located at "Learn > Resources > Vendor List." This groups it with other external resources, creating a go-to spot for members seeking supplies or services.
* BR-25 (Helpline Q&A where people can ask bonsai questions): This "Should" requirement, with the note "Would mostly want to do this if it could be behind members login," is situated within the "Members Area > Helpline Q&A." This respects the desire for a members-only environment for these discussions.
* BR-26 (Photography/image gallery as a feature that can be embedded wherever): This "Must" requirement is addressed in two ways: A general "Image Galleries" section is proposed under "Learn" for curated collections (e.g., exhibition highlights, outstanding member trees). Additionally, the sitemap supports embedding images and galleries within relevant content, such as "Events > Past Events Archive" pages and individual event detail pages, fulfilling the "embedded wherever" aspect.
5.2. Integration/Reorganization of Current Site Content
Content from the existing blueridgebonsaisociety.com website 2 will be migrated and reorganized within the new structure to improve usability and alignment with the new information architecture.
* Homepage Content 2: The current homepage is information-dense, particularly with event listings. The new homepage, guided by BR-24 for a cleaner design, will act as a summary and directional tool, featuring highlights and clear calls to action that link to the more detailed sections within the sitemap.
* Event Listings 2: All current and past event information will be migrated and structured into "Events > Upcoming Events," "Event Calendar," and "Events > Past Events Archive." Details for specific events, including workshops 2, will populate dedicated event detail pages, which will also include links for registration.
* "Tips, Advice, & More" page 2: Valuable content from this page, such as the "BRBS Monthly Bonsai Tips," Bjorn Bjorholm's summary on "Pesticides and Insecticides," and Daniel Coffey's presentation on the "Shag Rug" method, will be integrated into the "Learn > Articles & Tips" section. This content will be categorized and made searchable for easier access.
* "Our Library" 2: The contents of the current "Our Library" section will be reviewed. Relevant materials will be integrated into appropriate parts of the "Learn" section, potentially as downloadable resources or articles.
* Contact Information & Membership Hints 2: Information regarding contacting the society and hints about membership will be formalized and expanded within the dedicated "Contact Us" and "Join Us" sections, featuring clear forms and comprehensive information.
* "Bonsai as Fine Art" / TNCA Information 3: Content related to the partnership with The North Carolina Arboretum will be located in "About Us > Partnership with TNCA." Information about specific past exhibits, like "Bonsai as Fine Art," can be included in the "Events > Past Events Archive" or showcased in "Learn > Image Galleries." Artist biographies featured in this context 3 could be integrated into a "Learn > Featured Artists" sub-section or linked from relevant past event pages.
The following table provides an overview of how key content from the current site maps to the proposed new sitemap.

	This mapping ensures that valuable existing content is preserved and thoughtfully reorganized within the new, more user-friendly structure. This approach manages stakeholder expectations by demonstrating that the redesign is an evolution that enhances accessibility and usability, rather than a process that discards useful information. The improvements, such as making tips searchable or categorizing event information, highlight the tangible benefits of the new information architecture.
6. Excluded Requirements (Omit/Dupe, Won't - this time)
Several requirements identified in the initial data gathering phase 1 were assigned a priority of 'O' (Omit/Dupe) or 'W' (Won't - this time). These items are not directly incorporated into the proposed sitemap for this iteration, in line with their designated prioritization.1
The excluded requirements include:
* BR-35 (Better font(s)): Classified as 'O (Omit/Dupe)'. Font selection is a visual design decision rather than an information architecture component and will be addressed during the website's design phase.
* BR-36 (Ability to better track and understand user journeys): Classified as 'O (Omit/Dupe)'. This is often covered by basic analytics (BR-23, Priority S) and more advanced tracking is likely deferred.
* BR-18 (Ability to organize and communicate around monthly board meetings): Classified as 'O (Omit/Dupe)'. This functionality might be handled through offline tools or within a very restricted admin section not detailed in the public-facing sitemap.
* BR-41 (Email sign up form): Classified as 'W (Won't - this time)'. The functionality of collecting emails for communication lists may be indirectly covered by the "New Member Interest Form" or general contact forms, making a separate, dedicated newsletter sign-up form a lower priority for this phase.
* BR-45 (Social media - FB and/or Instagram): Classified as 'O (Omit/Dupe)'. This likely refers to developing a new or more integrated social media strategy rather than simply linking to existing pages, which can be done via footer links. The core sitemap focuses on on-site content.
* BR-47 (Well designed emails): Classified as 'W (Won't - this time)'. Email design is external to the website's sitemap, though website content might feed into emails.
* BR-48 (Social media - ideas for sub-channels/categorization): Classified as 'O (Omit/Dupe)'. This relates to social media strategy, not website structure.
* BR-28 (Chatting/direct message function): Classified as 'O (Omit/Dupe)'. Real-time chat is a complex feature and has been deprioritized.
* BR-43 (AI bonsai expert/chatbot): Classified as 'W (Won't - this time)'. This advanced feature is outside the current scope.
Acknowledging these exclusions is important for transparency and managing expectations. While not part of the current sitemap, some of these functionalities or design considerations may be revisited in future development phases. The decision to omit or defer these items allows for a focused effort on delivering the core "Must" and "Should" priority features effectively.
7. Considerations for Future Scalability
The proposed sitemap is designed not only to meet current requirements but also to provide a flexible framework that can accommodate future growth and the integration of additional features, particularly those identified with a "Could" (C) priority.1
* Blog (BR-39): The "Learn" section, with its planned "Articles & Tips" sub-section, can easily be expanded to include a dedicated "Blog." The existing structure already establishes a precedent for regularly updated, categorized, and potentially tagged content. A blog organized by tree development level, as suggested in BR-39, would fit naturally within this educational hub.
* Member Portfolios (BR-38): A "Member Portfolios" sub-section could be added under the "Learn" section if the goal is to publicly showcase member work, or within the "Members Area" if it's intended for internal viewing and sharing among members. The foundational concept for displaying visual content is already established with the "Image Gallery" feature, which can be adapted or extended for portfolios.
* Enhanced Communications (BR-15, BR-16, BR-46 YouTube): Should the society decide to implement more integrated email marketing tools or develop a YouTube channel for demonstrations and event recordings, the sitemap can readily support these. Links to a YouTube channel or embedded videos can be incorporated into relevant sections such as "Learn > Articles & Tips," event detail pages, or a dedicated "Video Gallery." The important note regarding artist intellectual property control and opt-out abilities is a critical content policy consideration that would need to be addressed before launching any video features.
A robust sitemap is not a static document but an evolving framework. By anticipating how "Could" priority requirements might be integrated later, the current design demonstrates foresight and ensures that future enhancements can be implemented as natural extensions of the existing structure, rather than requiring disruptive changes. This adaptability is key to the long-term viability and utility of the website.
8. Conclusion and Recommendations
The proposed sitemap provides a logical, user-centric, and comprehensive foundation for the new Blue Ridge Bonsai Society website. It systematically addresses the key requirements identified through stakeholder input 1 and offers a significant improvement in organization and usability over the current website.2 By prioritizing clarity, discoverability, and efficiency, this information architecture aims to enhance the experience for existing members, attract new enthusiasts, and effectively support the society's mission.
Recommendations for Next Steps:
1. Review and Approve Sitemap: The BRBS committee and relevant stakeholders should review this proposed sitemap and provide formal approval to proceed.
2. Detailed Content Mapping: Following sitemap approval, a detailed content mapping exercise should be undertaken. This involves assigning specific existing content pieces and identifying new content required for each page outlined in the sitemap.
3. Wireframe Development: Based on the approved sitemap and initial content mapping, wireframes should be developed for key page templates. This will help visualize page layouts, content hierarchy, and user flows before visual design commences.
4. Platform Evaluation and Selection: Careful consideration should be given to the website platform (e.g., Wix was mentioned in relation to BR-22 and BR-05). The chosen platform must adequately support the required functionalities, including the secure members-only area, discussion forums, event registration, and payment processing. The need for an easy-to-use WYSIWYG editor for content management and basic analytics capabilities should be key criteria in this evaluation.
5. Administrative Features Implementation: Ensure that administrative needs, such as the WYSIWYG editor and analytics, are properly configured during platform setup and website development.
6. Phased Rollout of "Could" Requirements: Once the core website based on "Must" and "Should" requirements is established and stable, the society can revisit and plan for the implementation of "Could" priority features (e.g., blog, member portfolios) as resources and needs dictate.
By following these recommendations, the Blue Ridge Bonsai Society can move confidently towards developing a new website that effectively meets its goals and serves its community for years to come.
